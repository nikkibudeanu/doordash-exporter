# Prism Text Styles Exporter plugin

This is a Figma plugin that exports every text style into [design-language](https://github.com/doordash/design-language) theme definitions.

## Getting Started

1. Open this directory in Visual Studio Code.
2. Compile TypeScript to JavaScript: Run the "Terminal > Run Build Task..." menu item,
    then select "tsc: watch - tsconfig.json". You will have to do this again every time
    you reopen Visual Studio Code.
3. In Figma -> Plugins -> Manage Plugins select "Create New Plugin" and "Link existing plugin". Select `manifest.json` from this directory. You can now run the plugin in any Figma document you have write access to.
